# central-group-frames
This repository contains code related to the paper "Optimal Line Packings From Nonabelian Groups", by J.W. Iverson, J. Jasper, and D.G. Mixon. The files "gap_code.g" and "sage_code.g" were used in the verification of Table 1. Their results are summarized in "table_1.g", which lists the groups implicated by that table. Finally, "b-prods.g" implements the infinite family of hyperdifference sets described in Sections 4 and 5. After importing that file into GAP with a command like `Read("b-prods.g");`, the user can produce the short, fat matrix promised by Theorem 5.1 with the command `hETF(n);`, where n is any odd integer greater than or equal to 3. This file also contains polycyclic representations of B-products over finite fields, and in particular can be used to further explore the groups created in our paper.
